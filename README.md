# Optical_Conditions_Tracing_System

A lighting conditions tracing system based on 8051 MCU, recording the illumination variation on 8x8 matrix.

* Designed sampling circuit based on 8Ã—8 photoresistor matirx and CD4051 analogue switches
* Used an analog-to-digital converter to get digital value of luminance
* Programmed with PWM to reproduce the luminance variation on output LED matrix based on the input matrix
